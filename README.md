# eleDistribution
Multi-scale modeling for conservation and connectivity of African savanna elephant in Tanzania.

## Overview
The repo contains documents and scripts for habitat and habitat connectivity analysis of African savanna elephants in Tanzania. The workflow has three parts:

1. Habitat suitability modeling at the coarse scales
2. Habitat suitability modeling at the fine scale
3. Habitat connectivity analysis

## Repo structure

The main things are documented as R markdown files in folder docs, within which functions stored in folder scripts may be called.

## Data

All data and results are available via Open Science Framework (OSF): [https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/5FWH4](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/5FWH4).

## Funding

This package is part of project "Combining Spatially-explicit Simulation of Animal Movement and Earth Observation to Reconcile Agriculture and Wildlife Conservation". This project is funded by NASA FINESST program (award number: 80NSSC20K1640) and U.S. National Science Foundation (award number: 2416164).
