Multi-scale modeling for conservation and connectivity of African savanna elephant in Tanzania.

## Overview
The repo contains documents and scripts for habitat and habitat connectivity analysis of African savanna elephnats in Tanzania. The workflow has three parts:

1. Habitat suitability modeling at the coarse scales
2. Habitat suitability modeling at the fine scale

## Repo structure

The main things are documented as R markdown files in folder docs, within which functions stored in folder scripts may be called.

## Funding

This package is part of project "Combining Spatially-explicit Simulation of Animal Movement and Earth Observation to Reconcile Agriculture and Wildlife Conservation". This project is funded by NASA FINESST program (award number: 80NSSC20K1640).
